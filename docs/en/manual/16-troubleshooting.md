# 16. When something goes wrong

[← Every shortcut](15-shortcuts.md) · [Contents](../user-guide.md) · [Next chapter: Glossary →](17-glossary.md)

Every message the studio can show, what it means, and what to do.

---

## The first place to look: the journal

Bottom right, next to the generations, an icon opens the **activity journal**. It keeps what the
studio has done and what it has failed to do, even while you were looking elsewhere.

When something did not go as expected, that is where to go **before** looking any further: it
names the object involved and says what failed.

| What the journal can report | Topic |
|---|---|
| "Generation “…” failed", "Generation “…” cancelled", "2 assets generated in Image and Modelling" | Generation |
| "Could not import “…”", "“…” is unreadable" | Import |
| "Could not send “…”", "The tags of “…” did not reach the library", "The Scenario API refused a request", "The file could not be shown" | Library |
| "Saving the document failed", "A layer could not be loaded", "Exporting the scene failed" | Document |
| "This folder is not a Scenario project", "The project could not be created in this folder", "The system could not open this file" | Project |
| "Part of the interface could not be drawn", "A workspace’s stored layout could not be read" | Interface |

Filter by **level** — information, warning, failure — or by **topic**: each is a menu whose
button says what it keeps. The detail is in [chapter 3](03-the-window.md#the-journal-next-to-it).

The panel closes three ways: a click beside it, `Escape`, or switching to another application.
Clicking the icon again works too. The same holds for the generations bar to its left.

> **A successful generation says which shelf it landed in** — useful as soon as a model produces
> something other than what the workspace you are in shows.

**A failure also raises a toast** in the corner, which does not fade on its own. If you missed
it, the red counter in the status line holds it until you open the journal.

---

## First: most messages are not errors

The studio writes a lot of sentences in empty panels. **These are not failures**: they are panels
telling you what they are missing in order to fill up.

| What you read | What it means |
|---|---|
| "No project open" | you need to create or open a project (`⌘N` / `⌘O`) |
| "No document open. Generate or open an asset to get started." | the centre of the window is waiting for a first tab |
| "No asset yet. Generate something to get started." | the project's shelf is still empty |
| "No job running." | nothing is working right now — the generations list is empty |
| "Open a project to generate." | the form is waiting for a project to drop the result into |
| "Open a project to see its assets." | the same, for the shelf |
| "Open a scene to see its contents." | the **Scene** panel is waiting for an open scene |
| "Open a scene to see its meshes." / "Open a scene to see its lights." | the same, for the two neighbouring panels |
| "No model chosen" / "Pick one from the list" | the Generation panel is waiting for a model to be selected |
| "This model takes no parameters." | that is normal: some models take only a prompt |
| "No result for this filter." | your search finds nothing; widen it |
| "No setting matches this search." | the same, in the settings window |
| "No action uses this key: it is free." | you can assign a shortcut to it |
| "This document is no longer open." | the tab was closed in the meantime |
| "No model in this workspace." | the catalogue is there, but no model matches this workspace |
| "Open an image to see its layers." | the Layers panel is waiting for an image document |
| "No mesh yet. Add one to get started." | the 3D scene is empty — the **+** button places one |
| "Open a scene to see its meshes." | the Meshes panel is waiting for a 3D scene |
| "No light. The scene will stay black." | you need at least one light to see anything |
| "Open a scene to see its lights." | the same, for the Lights panel |
| "Open a scene to inspect what is in it." | the Inspector is waiting for a 3D scene |
| "Select an object to see its properties." | the scene is there, nothing is selected |
| "Select something to see its properties." | the same thing, outside 3D |
| "Select a clip to see it here." | the Source monitor is waiting for a selection |
| "No sequence open. Create one to start editing." | the timeline is waiting for a sequence document — the **+** button |
| "Open a skybox to grade it." | the Skybox panel is waiting for a sky document |

None of these sentences calls for troubleshooting. The rest of the chapter is about real failures.

## Connection messages

They appear in red under the fields of the **Account** section of settings, or in the **Models**
panel when it cannot show anything.

### "No credentials saved."

**What it means.** No account is stored, or the one that was has been removed.

**What to do.** Settings (`⌘,`) → **Account** → give it a name, paste your key and secret →
**Add an account**. They are taken from [app.scenario.com](https://app.scenario.com).

### "The keychain did not give your accounts back. Try again once it is unlocked — nothing was changed."

**What it means.** Your system's vault is locked, and the studio could not read your account list
back.

**The end of that sentence is what matters most.** The studio **refused to write** rather than write
halfway: unable to read the existing list, saving an account would have replaced it with that one
alone. Your other accounts are intact.

**What to do.** Unlock your keychain — on macOS, open "Keychain Access" and authenticate; on Linux,
unlock the desktop keyring — then start again.

### "Enter your API credentials to see your models."

The same thing, said by the **Models** panel. The catalogue comes from the service: with no account
connected, there is nothing to list.

### "Invalid API key or secret."

**What it means.** The service replied that this pair means nothing to it.

**What to do, in order:**

1. **check there is no space** stuck to the start or the end of what you pasted. This is by far the
   most frequent cause;
2. **check you have not swapped** the key and the secret;
3. **regenerate the pair** at [app.scenario.com](https://app.scenario.com) and paste it again.

> **This message does not fix itself.** The studio **never** retries an invalid key, whatever the
> "Max retries" setting says: retrying would not fix it, it would only delay this message.

### "This API key lacks the required permissions."

**What it means.** The key is valid, but it is not allowed to do what you just asked — or your plan
does not cover it.

**What to do.** Check the key's permissions and your subscription's state at
[app.scenario.com](https://app.scenario.com). A read-only key, for instance, can list models without
being able to launch a generation.

### "Cannot reach Scenario. Check your connection."

**What it means.** The request never arrived. This is not a refusal from the service, it is the
journey that failed.

**What to do:**

1. check you actually have internet;
2. if you are behind a corporate firewall or a VPN, try without;
3. try again: the studio already does so on its own (see below), but a long outage exhausts its
   attempts.

### "The Scenario service is temporarily unavailable."

**What it means.** The service answered, but only to say it has a problem of its own. This does not
come from you.

**What to do.** Wait. The studio retries on its own, spacing out its attempts. If it lasts, check
[status.scenario.com](https://status.scenario.com) or Scenario's support.

### "Resource not found."

**What it means.** The studio asked for something specific — a model, an asset — that no longer
exists, or is not available to your account.

**What to do.** The common case is a model withdrawn from the catalogue since you chose it. Refresh
the **Models** panel and take another.

### "An unexpected error occurred."

**What it means.** Something failed in a way the studio could not name.

**What to do.** Try once more. If it happens again, open the **activity journal**: the line for the
failure carries, in small type, the technical name of what failed and the error message. That is
what to copy into a request for help.

> **No error message from the service is shown to you as-is.** The studio translates them all into
> one of these sentences. That is not laziness: a raw error message contains the request that
> produced it, therefore the authentication header, therefore **your API key**. It must never reach
> the screen, where it would end up in a screenshot posted to a forum.

---

## When part of the screen breaks down

Two messages that do not come from the service, but from the studio itself. They appear **in
place of** what should have been drawn, with a **Try again** button.

### "This panel ran into an error."

**What it means.** One panel failed to draw. The rest of the window — your documents, your other
panels, your running generations — **carries on working normally**.

**What to do.** Click **Try again**: the panel rebuilds itself. Nine times out of ten it comes back.

**What you do not lose**: nothing. A panel is a view onto data that lives elsewhere.

### "The application ran into an error."

**What it means.** The same thing, one notch up: the whole window could not be drawn.

**What to do.** **Try again** first. If the screen returns to the same state, close the window and
open it again.

> **Neither screen says what failed.**
>
> **The failure does leave a trace, though** — and the journal is the only place to read it. It
> keeps a line for it under the **Interface** topic — "Part of the interface could not be drawn" —
> followed, in small type, by the technical name of the area at fault and the error message. That
> is what to copy into a report.
>
> **An open project keeps it**: the line is written into the project and can be read back later.
> With no project open, it appears but does not outlive the session. And **it is written once per
> area at fault**: if **Try again** fails at the same place, no new line is added.
>
> **What is saved on disk is safe.** A drawing crash touches neither your assets nor documents
> already written.

---

## Generation messages

They appear on the job's line, in the list opened by the generations summary, bottom right of the
window.

### "Too many requests. Retrying…"

**What it means.** You asked for more than the service accepts in a short span of time.

**What the studio does on its own.** It waits, then retries — doubling the wait each time: 1 second,
then 2, then 4, then 8. This is called **exponential backoff**, and it is the right behaviour:
retrying immediately, in a loop, worsens the congestion instead of resolving it.

**What you can do.** If this comes back often, lower **Concurrent generations** in settings. Three is
the starting value; two is plenty to work comfortably.

> **This message has become rare.** The studio now bounds its call **rate**, not just how many
> generations run in parallel: those were two different things, and counting one did not cover
> the other. Seeing it often anyway means another tool is using the same key at the same time.

### "The generation failed."

**What it means.** The service did receive the request, processed it, and returned a failure. This is
neither a network problem nor an account problem.

**The ordinary causes:**

- **a refused parameter** — a dimension this model does not accept, a value outside its bounds;
- **a refused prompt** — the service applies its own content rules;
- **an unusable input image** — too large, too small, in a format the model does not take.

**What to do.** Start again from the form: restore the parameters to their default values (the small
restore button beside each one), and relaunch. If it goes through, reintroduce your values one at a
time to find the one that was blocking.

> **This message is never retried automatically.** A refused request will be refused identically the
> next time: only a change on your part can get it through.

### "Could not save the result to disk."

**What it means.** The generation **succeeded** — the image exists — but the studio could not write
it into your project.

**The ordinary causes:**

- **the disk is full**;
- **the project folder was moved, renamed or deleted** while the job was working;
- **the folder is read-only**, or on a network drive that unmounted;
- **the project is in a synchronised folder** (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive) that grabbed the file at
  the wrong moment.

**What to do.** Free up space, check the project folder is still where it was, and relaunch the
generation.

> **A project in a synchronised folder is a source of trouble.** Those services move and rewrite
> files while you work. Prefer a local folder, and back it up some other way.

### Which errors are retried, and which are not

The studio only retries **what another attempt can repair**.

| Message | Retried? |
|---|---|
| Too many requests | **yes** |
| Service unavailable | **yes** |
| Cannot reach Scenario | **yes** |
| Invalid key or secret | no |
| Insufficient permissions | no |
| Resource not found | no |
| The generation failed | no |
| Could not save | no |
| Unexpected error | no |

The number of attempts is adjustable: Settings → **Generation** → **Max retries** (4 by default, 0
to 10).

---

## Import messages

They appear while a file you dropped into the project is being prepared.

### The normal steps

| What you read | What is happening |
|---|---|
| **Waiting…** | the file is queuing |
| **Probing…** | the studio reads its duration, size, format |
| **Fingerprinting…** | it computes its signature, to recognise a duplicate |
| **Proxy…** | it makes the lightweight copy that keeps scrubbing smooth |
| **Waveform…** | it draws the soundtrack |
| **Ready** | it is finished, the file is usable |

The **Stop preparing this file** button halts the work in progress. **Remove from the list** takes
the line away once it is finished.

### "Video preparation unavailable: no lighter copy, no waveform."

**Where it shows.** On an amber warning triangle, on the asset shelf's title bar: hover it, or
reach it with the keyboard. The same state is written out in full, and permanently, in
**Settings ▸ Media**.

**What it means.** No usable ffmpeg was found — not even the one the application carries.

**What still works.** The import itself. Your file is in the project, it plays, it edits.

**What is missing.** Scrubbing the timeline stutters on large files (no lightweight copy), and audio
tracks do not show their waves.

**What to do.** The studio ships its own ffmpeg on all three systems, so this message should not
appear on a normally installed application. If it does anyway:

1. **you ran the studio from its source code** — run `pnpm ffmpeg:fetch`, which downloads the
   missing binaries;
2. **the shipped binary is there but does not start** — it is the one being kept, and a path you
   set in Settings → **Media** → **Path to ffmpeg** does not replace it: that field only matters
   when the shipped binary is absent. Repair or replace that one;
3. **otherwise**, doing without stays perfectly viable on short or light files.

#### The puzzling case: ffmpeg is there, and the studio says it is not

You type `which ffmpeg` in a terminal, it answers a path. The file exists. And the studio keeps
saying video preparation is unavailable.

**This is not a contradiction.** The studio does not merely *find* the program: it **runs** the one
it has kept, with `ffmpeg -version`, and announces video preparation only if it answers. An ffmpeg
installed by Homebrew whose library has gone missing — after a macOS update, or a slightly
over-eager `brew cleanup` — still exists as a file, but no longer starts.

**Mind what "kept" means**: the studio takes the **first candidate present** — shipped, then the
settings one, then the `PATH` — and does not walk back down the list. The `which ffmpeg` you just
typed is therefore only consulted when the other two are missing.

**To check for yourself**, in a terminal:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

If that command prints a version number, ffmpeg is fine. If it complains about a missing library,
that is your diagnosis.

**To fix it**, on macOS:

```bash
brew reinstall ffmpeg
```

### "Already in the project"

**What it means.** This file has the same fingerprint as an asset already present. The studio
refuses to keep two copies.

**This is not an error.** Look for it in the **Assets** panel: it is already there.

### "Unreadable file"

**What it means.** The studio cannot open this file.

**The ordinary causes:** a truncated file (interrupted download), an extension that lies about the
content, an exotic format, or a file protected by digital rights.

**What to do.** Open it in another player to check it is sound. If it is, convert it to a common
format (`.mp4`, `.wav`, `.png`).

> **Not to be confused** with "This clip could not be shown", below: there the import
> succeeded, and it is showing it in a monitor that fails.

### "Failed" / "Stopped"

**Failed**: preparation stopped on a problem. **Stopped**: you halted it yourself. In both cases,
the file can be imported again.

### "This asset could not be opened"

**What it means.** You double-clicked an asset and it did not arrive. It is neither a bug nor a
damaged file. **The journal line says which of the four causes it was**, in grey beside the
message.

| What the detail says | What happened | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `no destination` | **the ordinary case**: no workspace knows how to open this kind of asset | right-click lists what this asset can become |
| `not on disk` | the asset is in your Scenario library, not on this disk yet | fetch it into the project — see [Assets](07-assets.md) |
| `no project` | no project is open, and a document is a file: it needs a folder | open or create a project |
| `no document` | the document could not be created | check that the project folder can be written to |

> **Double-click opens a tab when it needs to.** It reuses the asset's own tab when that is
> already open, and creates one otherwise: there is no destination to prepare. Right-click, on
> the other hand, lists everything this asset can become without trying any of it.

---

## Dictation messages

### "Dictation needs a recognition model, downloaded once and for all."

Not a fault: it is the first time. The model weighs 640 MB and is never fetched without being
asked. Click, and carry on working while it downloads — it gets in the way of nothing.

### "Microphone access was refused."

You answered no to the system's request, and **macOS never asks again**. The "Open the system
settings" button takes you to the exact place to allow it. The studio then has to be restarted.

### "The downloaded model is damaged; it has been removed."

The file arrived incomplete or corrupted — a dropped connection, a proxy that rewrites, a full
disk. The studio deleted it rather than load a model it does not trust. Start the download again.

### "The model could not be downloaded."

The network gave up. What had arrived is kept: the next attempt **resumes where it stopped**, it
does not start the 640 MB again.

### "Speech recognition stopped."

The engine quit mid-way. It restarts on its own at the next dictation, up to three times; past
that the studio stops trying rather than relaunch a process that dies on every sentence. The
detail goes to the technical console (**Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ Developer tools**), not on screen:
it names a file path, which helps nobody in front of the screen and tells everything to whoever
reads the log.

### "No microphone available."

No audio input answered. A USB headset unplugged mid-dictation gives this message: plug it back
in, or let the studio take the built-in microphone.

### The text is written nowhere

Dictation writes **at the caret**, in the field it sits in. If the caret is in no text field,
there is nowhere to write and nothing happens: click into the field first.

### The level does not move when you speak

The microphone is hearing nothing. Check which one your computer is using (System Settings ▸
Sound ▸ Input), and that it is not a muted input — some audio interfaces expose those.

---

## The editing messages

### "This clip could not be shown: its media is missing, or its format cannot be read here."

**What it means.** The clip is there on its track, but the monitor cannot get a picture out of
it. It says so in place of the picture, rather than staying black.

**The ordinary causes:** an `.exr`, a `.tif` or a `.tiff` — those three import as pictures but no
monitor shows them — or a truncated video file.

**What to do.** Convert the file to `.png` (picture) or `.mp4` (video) with another tool, then
import it again: **the studio converts nothing on its own.** The clip stays on its track and
keeps its duration; only its picture is missing.

---

## When the studio is driven from outside

What follows concerns only the way in for a program outside, covered in
[chapter 20](20-driving-from-outside.md). Every action refusal is listed there; these are the
connection troubles.

### "The box is ticked, but my client will not connect"

**The commonest cause: the line is from an earlier launch.** The port and the token change every
time the studio starts. Yesterday's points at a port where nothing is listening any more.

**What to do.** **Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ Connection command ▸ Copy**, and paste the line into your
terminal again. A client already registered under the same name is replaced, so there is nothing to
remove first.

### "The box is ticked, the line is fresh, and still nothing is listening"

**What it means.** The way in failed to start — another program held the place, or the system
refused. **The box stays ticked**, because it describes what you asked for, not what succeeded.

**What to do. Untick it, then tick it again.** That is what asks for a start — and one is needed:
after a failure, ticking an already-ticked box relaunches nothing. Restarting the studio has the
same effect.

### "An action refuses, saying no window is in front"

**What it means.** The studio is running, but none of its windows is there to act — nor to put the
question a costly action requires to you.

**What to do.** Open a studio window, and ask again. **That refusal is never a silent yes**:
nothing ran, and nothing was spent.

### "My client waits, then gives up"

**What it means.** A question stood on screen unanswered. The studio gives up on it after **two
minutes** and answers a refusal, rather than leaving the client waiting for good.

**What to do.** Look at the studio window before asking again: the request was waiting there for an
**Allow** or a **Refuse**.

---

## The troubles that show no message

These are the most disconcerting: nothing is written, but something is wrong.

### "I hear nothing during playback"

There is no message: the sound stays quiet without saying so. Seven causes, from the most
ordinary to the most technical:

1. **The track is muted, or another one is soloed.** Solo wins over everything: as soon as one
   track is soloed, the others go quiet. See [a track's header](10-video-workspace.md).
2. **You are dragging the playhead by hand.** Sound only comes out during playback; scrubbing is
   silent.
3. **The clip sits on a picture track.** A video laid there is seen without being heard: only
   sound tracks are played.
4. **You are watching the Source monitor on a video.** It plays a selected sound clip, but not
   a video's own sound — that one is played nowhere yet.
5. **The clip's gain is at the floor.** A clip's inspector gives it in decibels.
6. **The media moved since it was imported.** The studio does not ask for it sixty times a
   second: it gives the clip up for the session. Import the file again.
7. **The very first sound is late.** The file is decoded whole before it plays; on a long pad the
   first second may be skipped rather than played late.

### "I paint and nothing lands"

**Look at the cursor before you drag.** If it is a no-entry sign, the tool is telling you it can
do nothing where it is, and it tells you **before** the gesture.

| What is blocking | How to clear it |
|---|---|
| A **group** is armed in the stack | pick a layer, not the group holding it |
| The active layer is an **adjustment layer** | it has no pixels to paint: take the layer below |
| Its **pixels are locked** | unlock it in the Layers panel |
| Its **position is locked** | same thing, for the Move tool |

If the cursor is normal and nothing appears anyway, it is elsewhere: a **selection** may be drawn
outside the area you are painting — the brush, the eraser and the bucket only act inside it. `⌘D`
drops it.


### "⌘Z does nothing"

**The cause, almost always.** The action you want to undo belongs to **another tab**.

Each document has its own undo stack. `⌘Z` steps back in the **active** tab, not in the last gesture
you made in the studio.

**What to do.** Activate the tab concerned, then undo.

### "The canvas is black after detaching a panel"

**The cause.** A 3D view does not survive being moved from one window to another: the graphics card
takes back its drawing context.

**What to do.** Close the tab and reopen it. The view rebuilds itself from the scene — you lose no
work, only the display.

### "The interface freezes for a few seconds during a search"

**The cause.** A search across a very large catalogue.

**What to do.** Wait; it unblocks. To avoid it, type more letters before launching the search, or
narrow it with the filters.

### "Playback stutters for no reason"

**Two possible causes:**

1. **there is no proxy** — see the ffmpeg message above. This is the most frequent case on a heavy
   video;
2. **the machine is loaded** — a running generation consumes the network, and a 3D scene open in
   another tab consumes the graphics card.

**What to do.** Close the tabs you are not using, and check that ffmpeg is available.

### "The interface animations stutter"

Settings → **Appearance** → tick **Limit animations**. Panels appear at once instead of sliding in,
which is far more pleasant than a jerky slide.

### "I lost my work when I closed a tab"

**This is not supposed to be possible any more.** All document kinds save, and closing a tab
whose work is not written asks first: *Save*, *Don’t save*, *Cancel*.

**If no question came up**, the document was clean — no dot (`•`) beside its name. Two known
cases:

- **the document was never saved and never received anything**: there was nothing to keep;
- **its file could not be read when it opened.** The studio then deliberately refuses to save it,
  so as not to write an empty document over the one it could not read — the file is the only
  copy. The reason is in the activity journal.

**What never comes back**: the **undo history**. Reopening a document means starting
again without `⌘Z`. The complete list is in [What does not exist yet](18-limits.md).

### "I deleted a document by mistake"

**Nothing gives it back.** *Delete document…* in a tab's context menu removes the file from the
project folder, and the studio has no wastebasket. That is why the confirmation has *Cancel* as
its default button.

If the project folder is in a system backup (Time Machine, a synced folder), that is where to go
and look for it.

### "The panels are all over the place and I am lost"

Menu **View** → **Reset layout**. The panels take their original places back. **Your work is not
touched** — only the window's arrangement is.

### "The studio does not remember my settings"

**The likely cause.** You closed the settings window without **Apply**, and chose "Don’t apply" at
the question asked.

**What to do.** Start again, and finish with **Apply** or **OK**.

### "Nothing happens when I click Generate"

Three checks, in this order:

1. **is a project open?** Otherwise the form shows "Open a project to generate.";
2. **is a model chosen?** Otherwise the panel shows "No model chosen";
3. **are you connected?** The dot on the account switcher, top right, must be green.

## Going further

### The log

**The activity journal, the one on the status line, is the only trace readable from inside the
application** — and it is what to attach when you ask for help. Every failure leaves a line there,
with its time. **When the studio has a technical detail to give**, it writes it in small type under
the message: that is the case for drawing failures, for refusals from the API and for failed
uploads to the library. Project failures carry none — the path you picked in a dialogue would teach
nothing more. An open project keeps the line: it is written into the project and can be read back
later.

> **Two settings in the Advanced section do not help here, and it is worth knowing before trying
> them.** **Log detail** governs what the studio writes to *its own* internal log, which is only
> readable from a terminal — not in the build you installed — and it changes nothing in what the
> Activity panel shows. **Developer tools** opens nothing either: the console is refused outside a
> development build, deliberately — see [chapter 14](14-settings.md#developer-tools).

### The settings file

Settings → **Advanced** → **Settings file** → **Show in folder**. It opens in your file manager.

**You can share it without fear for your credentials**: they are encrypted by your session's
keychain, and unreadable elsewhere. But you may also prefer not to send it at all — it holds all your
settings, including the paths of your folders.

### Starting over

Settings → **Advanced** → **Reset everything**. Puts every setting back to a fresh install.

**Your projects are not touched.** But the operation is final: there is no undo.

## The survival table

| Symptom | First thing to try |
|---|---|
| The model catalogue is empty | **Settings ▸ Account**, then sign in |
| "Invalid API key or secret." | look for a stray space in what was pasted |
| "Too many requests" repeatedly | lower **Concurrent generations** to 2 |
| "Generation “…” failed" | restore the model's parameters to default, relaunch |
| "Saving the document failed" | check disk space and that the project folder exists |
| Stuttering timeline | check that video preparation is available, or shorten the video |
| No waves on the audio track | the same |
| "Video preparation unavailable" although `which ffmpeg` finds one | run `ffmpeg -version`: the binary exists but no longer starts |
| "The keychain did not give your accounts back" | unlock the keychain, then start again — nothing was lost |
| "This asset could not be opened" | read the grey detail: it says which of the four causes it was |
| "This panel ran into an error" | click **Try again** — the rest of the window is fine |
| `⌘Z` has no effect | activate the right tab |
| Black 3D canvas | close and reopen the tab |
| Panels in disorder | View → Reset layout |
| A workspace came back to its default arrangement on its own | its stored layout could not be read, so it was dropped rather than kept — the journal says so under **Interface**. Rearrange it: the new arrangement is stored again |
