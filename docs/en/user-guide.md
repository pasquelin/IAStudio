# Scenario Studio — the manual

Welcome. This manual explains **everything** Scenario Studio does, from your first launch to
everyday work.

It is written to be read by someone who has never opened a creative application, without lying to
someone who opens one every day. When a difficult word is unavoidable, it is explained where it
first appears, then repeated in the [glossary](manual/17-glossary.md).

> 🇫🇷 Ce manuel existe aussi [en français](../fr/guide-utilisateur.md).
> Looking for how the software is **built** instead? See [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## In three sentences

Scenario Studio is an application that installs on your computer. It can **make** images, videos,
sounds, 3D objects, materials and skies — by asking artificial-intelligence models, online, at
[Scenario](https://www.scenario.com). And it can then **assemble, adjust and file them**, on your
machine, without sending them anywhere.

## The five-minute tour

If you only read one thing, read this. It is the whole path, from a closed application to a first
image in your project.

**1. Connect your account.**
Open settings with `⌘,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows, Linux). Go to **Account**. Give the account a
**name**, then paste your **API key** and **API secret**, taken from
[app.scenario.com](https://app.scenario.com). Click **Add an account**: the studio checks them
straight away and puts a green **In use** badge on the row.

**2. Create a project.**
`⌘N` / `Ctrl+N`. Choose a folder and a name. A project is a **folder on your disk**: everything
you make will land inside it.

**3. Choose a workspace.**
At the top of the window, six tabs: **Image**, **Video**, **3D**, **Audio**, **Textures**,
**Skyboxes**. Click **Image**.

**4. Choose a model.**
On the right, the **Models** panel shows the catalogue. Click a thumbnail you like. The chosen
model's name appears at the top of the panel.

**5. Describe what you want.**
Just below, the **Generate** panel shows a form. The most important field is called the
**prompt**: it is your instruction sentence, preferably in English.
For example: `a small red lighthouse on a cliff, morning light`.

**6. Press Generate.**
The request leaves. Bottom right of the window, the status line shows "1 generation" with a bar that
fills. Click it for the detail. You can keep working while it runs.

**7. Collect the result.**
When the job reaches "Done", the image arrives in the **Assets** panel — the project's shelf —
and on your disk, in the `assets/img/` folder. Click it: the **Inspector**, on the right, shows
its model, its prompt and its seed, and can open the folder holding it.

That is all. The rest of the manual details each of these seven steps, and the five other
workspaces.

## How to read this manual

**You do not have to read it in order.** Each chapter stands on its own and points to the others
when it needs to.

Three conventions recur throughout:

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| `⌘S` / `Ctrl+S` | A keyboard shortcut. The first form is macOS, the second Windows and Linux |
| **Generate** in bold | The exact name of a button, panel or menu, as written on screen |
| > A quoted box | A warning, or a limit worth knowing before you hit it |

The keyboard symbols, once and for all:

| Symbol | Key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `⌘` | Command | macOS. Replaced by `Ctrl` elsewhere |
| `⇧` | Shift | everywhere |
| `⌥` | Option / Alt | everywhere |
| `⌃` | Control | macOS |

## One important thing, before everything else

**Your credentials never leave your machine.** They are encrypted by your operating system's
keychain — the same vault that holds your passwords — and only the part of the software that talks
to Scenario can reach them. The screen you are looking at never knows what your key is: it only
knows whether it is connected.

**Neither do your files.** Your projects are ordinary folders on your disk. Nothing is sent
anywhere, except what you explicitly ask to generate — that is, the text of your prompt and, where
relevant, the image you supply as input.
