/**
 * What a frame of physics costs under Jolt, on the four reference scenes and nothing else — the
 * same objects the Rapier bench reads, so the two columns answer one question.
 *
 * 🛑 The awake count is in the name of every case, and it is half the measure: an engine that
 * puts bodies to sleep sooner reads faster for a reason that has nothing to do with its solver.
 * The switch reads BOTH columns or neither.
 *
 * Memory is NOT read here — a bench is where a leak hides. `joltPhysics.test.ts` holds it, by
 * asking the WebAssembly heap to be exactly where it was a thousand steps earlier.
