 * Two thousand bodies throughout, and only the DEPTH of the stack changes. The one series that

 * 🛑 Measured 2026-09-01, one layer against sixteen: Rapier holds a flat 0,85–1,45 µs a contact
 * point whatever the shape, Jolt walks from 0,79 to 1,69. Jolt is 2,3 times faster on a wide
 * shallow sheet — which is what a level is — and 1,9 times slower on a deep pile. **The crossing
 * is near five stacked layers**, and that is the production risk this file keeps honest.
