/**
 * The series where only the NUMBER of bodies changes — same geometry, same density, same drop, no
 * furniture. What says whether the engine drifts with N rather than with a scene's shape.
 *
 * 🛑 It exists because `physics-500 → 2000 → 5000` is NOT monotone, and that is measured: at 5 000
 * the pile is sixteen layers, nineteen metres, and part of it is still falling when the clock
 * starts. Interactions per active body read LOWER there than at 2 000, so a gap read on that
 * series says the geometry, not the load.
