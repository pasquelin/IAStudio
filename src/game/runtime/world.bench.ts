/**
 * What one fixed step costs before anything draws.
 *
 * The frame is 16,7 ms and the measurements of 2026-08-26 already spend 1,42 ms of it on 500
 * physics bodies and 200 scripted entities. This says what the world itself takes on top — the
 * sweep of an indexed store and the ordered walk of the systems, with no rendering at all.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-26 on this Mac: **0,0026 ms** a step for a thousand entities (p99 0,0060) and
 * 0,0213 ms for ten thousand — 0,016 % of the frame, and it scales with the entities the index
 * SELECTS rather than with the scene. Nothing here is the thing to optimise.
 *
 * A second pass after the review's fixes read 0,0027 min for a thousand, but on a machine running
 * three other sessions: ±13 % against ±0,13 %. **Read both as « under three microseconds », never
 * as a difference** — the two were not measured under the same load.
