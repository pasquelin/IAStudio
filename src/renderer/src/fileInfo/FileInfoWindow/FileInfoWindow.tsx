 * The file is named by the URL FRAGMENT, not by a selection, which is the whole difference with
 * the inspector panel: that one answers for whatever the main window holds at that instant.
 *
 * One block, scrolled, its runs told apart by the rule `PropertyGroup` already draws — no column
 * and no tabs, since a reader after a size should not have to find which screen holds it.
