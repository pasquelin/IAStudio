 * The catalogue turned the two ways a file NAME resolves back to a row — which is the direction no
 * store offers, every one of them being keyed by id.
 *
 * Built once per catalogue rather than once per document opened: every montage opened in a session
 * walked every asset the window had been shown, and that set only grows. Keyed on the map's
 * identity, which `assetsById` already memoises on the asset list, so this rebuilds exactly when
 * the catalogue changes and never otherwise.
 *
 * **The blind spot, written rather than hidden**: `assetsById` holds every asset this window has
 * been SHOWN, not the whole catalogue. A file whose row has never been listed here answers nothing.
 * Asking the catalogue by path (`helpers/assetAt`) is a round trip, and the readers that need this
 * — `DocumentIo.install` among them — are synchronous.
