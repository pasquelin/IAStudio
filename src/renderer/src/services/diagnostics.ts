/**
 * The scopes whose failures follow a gesture the user made — a ⌘S, an export, a tab closed.
 *
 * They are reported every time. Everything else is reported once per subject, because an engine
 * is rebuilt on every detach and every reopen (invariant 3) and asks again for the same missing
 * asset: without that, a project whose folder moved refills the journal on each detach. That is
 * also why `document.load` is NOT here — it is reported from a mount effect, not from a gesture.
 *
 * A repeated gesture is the opposite case. Somebody pressed the key a second time precisely
 * because the first did nothing, and answering that with silence is how a save that keeps
 * failing looks like a save that worked.
 *
 * Here rather than in `shared/ipc.ts`: nothing about this crosses the boundary. It is what this
 * module does with a scope, not what a scope is.

  // a refusal said once reads as a save that worked.

  // that said nothing at all — the caller swallowed everything it threw.

  // said nothing, and a shelf whose row does nothing twice in silence reads as a dead menu.

  // A drop is a gesture: dropping the same cloud picture twice must say so twice, which is the
  // very defect `feat/documents-erreurs` fixed for the others.

  // nothing, and a silent button is how a measurement that keeps failing looks like one that ran.

  // first attempt failed — silenced, a second try looks exactly like a dialog somebody dismissed.
