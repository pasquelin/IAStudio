 * How a value that does not fit its column is given room.

 * `inline` truncates, which is right for a number or a name. `stacked` drops the value onto its
 * own line under the label — a prompt, a paragraph. `wrap` keeps the two columns and lets the
 * value run onto a second line, for a value with no head and no tail: a hash.
 *
 * `path` is the same column, clipped at its HEAD — `Images/Croquis/etude.jpg` broken mid-word
 * costs a line and shows nothing the far end did not already say, the file's own name being
 * what a reader looks for. The same reading `Row` gives a path with `clip="start"`.

 *
 * NO inset and no padding of its own, on either axis: the group holding the row is what insets
 * and what spaces its children. The fields beside it carry none either, so a row that added its
 * own started eight pixels further in than the control right under it and stood twice as far
 * from its neighbour.
 *
 * It wears `FIELD_ROW` and `FIELD_LABEL` — the very shapes `NumberField` and its family wear.
 * Those two constants already claimed to be shared with this file and were spelt out here by
 * hand; a group draws both families side by side, so one of them drifting is two label columns
 * in the same box.
