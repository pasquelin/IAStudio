/**
 * The frame of a window that is NOT a dock — a title bar, a column, a pane beside it.
 *
 * Written once because it was written three times. Settings and Usage already carried the same
 * header, the same `w-56` bordered column and the same `min-w-0 flex-1 overflow-auto` pane, and
 * `UsageWindow` said so in its own docstring — "built on the settings window's shape rather than
 * its own". The manual arrived as a third copy, in the STUDIO's tokens rather than DaisyUI's,
 * which is how a window can pass every test and still not look like the application it is in.
 *
 * DaisyUI here, deliberately: these are the surfaces where the studio becomes an ordinary
 * application. The docks speak the other vocabulary, and the two must not end up in one bag —
 * see `windowStyles.ts`, which draws the same boundary for the class strings.
 *
 * `TooltipHost` is mounted here rather than by each window. It is per-window and easy to forget:
 * without it, tooltip attributes write a sentence nobody ever sees.
 *
 * 🛑 The ground is `bg-chassis`: the main process paints the window with that very value before the
 * first frame — `WINDOW_CHROME_COLOR` restates `--color-chassis` — so a DaisyUI ground opened on
 * one colour and settled on another. `window-ground.test.ts` holds the two together.
