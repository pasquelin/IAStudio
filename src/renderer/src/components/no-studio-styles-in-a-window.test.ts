 * never heard of. A window that is not a dock reaching for them puts the two vocabularies in one
 * bag, and that is how `chipSkin` and `windowControl` came to write colours the other side cannot
 * resolve.

 * 🛑 **Its blind spot, written rather than hidden.** It reads the IMPORT, one hop. A window that
 * reaches `styles.ts` THROUGH a component of `design/` stays green, and must: a dock component
 * wears its own vocabulary wherever it is mounted. The journal is the witness — it renders
 * `ActivityList`, whose row imports the status tones, and that row belongs to the dock as much.
