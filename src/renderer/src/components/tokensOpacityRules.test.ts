 * even the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a glyph — and each was moved toward black until it cleared.
 * `create` is held here although it also fills, because two sources write `text-create` — and a
 * green that carries a word at 4.5 carries the rail's white glyph well past the 3:1 of 1.4.11.

 * element inherits, and what that is lives on an ancestor no text can follow. A file-level guard
 * that tried to read colour through it was written and RETIRED on 2026-08-12, proven to catch
 * none of the five defects it was written for.
 *
 * So this holds the only thing a text can hold, and says so: **no site dims without a reason.**
 * It is what would have caught the price inside the primary button — white at `opacity-70` on
 * the accent, 3.03:1 at rest — which is neither an ink with an alpha nor a token, and which
 * fourteen iterations and two guards walked past.
 *
 * `opacity-0` and `opacity-100` are not dimmings but reveals, and a `disabled` on the same line
 * is WCAG 1.4.3's own exemption: a control that refuses the click owes no ratio.
 *
 * Comments are cut away first, and that is not a detail: this rule flagged its OWN explanation
 * and the one in `styles.ts` on its first run. A guard that reddens when somebody writes down why
 * is a guard that teaches people to stop writing down why.
 *
 * **What it does NOT hold**, so nobody reads it as more than it is: `style={{ opacity: 0.7 }}`
 * writes no class and is invisible to it; `disabled` is looked for on the LINE, so an unrelated
 * `disabled &&` on a long `cn()` call excuses a dimming beside it; and an exemption is by FILE,
 * so a second dimming added to `Tree.tsx` inherits the first one's reason. None of the three
