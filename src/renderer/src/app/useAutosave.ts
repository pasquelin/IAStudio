 * "done editing" that no editor here has.
 *
 * Rearmed AFTER each pass rather than on an interval, which is the whole reason this is not
 * three lines: a pass slower than the gap — a large scene, a montage — would otherwise start
 * again on top of itself, capturing the same editors twice at once.
