 * document created and never saved is in no folder to be read, so its panel is restored alone
 * and says it is not open.
 *
 * Absent from the folder is NOT the condition: a document created during the session is absent
 * from it too, and sweeping on that alone would close a tab under the hands that opened it.
 * The store is read here rather than passed in — a row adopted while the listing travelled
 * belongs to the answer. Called only on a folder that answered, per `refresh`.
