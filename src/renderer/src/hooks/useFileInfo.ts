 * moves, which is what keeps « this entry is no longer there » true rather than merely true at
 * the moment the window opened.
 *
 * NOT through `useGitStatus`: that hook also reads the remotes and re-asks on every window
 * focus, for a panel that draws a server bar. This window draws a branch and one line, and a
 * second `git` process per focus per window is not what it costs to show them.
 *
 * `reading` is DERIVED from which path the held answer belongs to, never set in the effect: a
 * synchronous `setState` there cascades a render, and comparing the two paths says the same
