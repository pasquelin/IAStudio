 * Where a settled sentence goes, when it is not going to the caret.

 * the studio without a single one of them being rewritten. This is the way out of that, and it
 * is declared BY the surface that wants the words rather than reached for by the session.
 *
 * The direction matters: dictation is an input service, and a service that had to know which
 * feature is on screen would gain a branch per feature. Here it knows only that somebody may
 * have claimed the words, and asks.
