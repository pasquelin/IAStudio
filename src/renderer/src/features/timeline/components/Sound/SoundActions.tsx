 * The player itself lives in the programme monitor, as the picture pair's does — this row only
 * asks it, through the registry both surfaces share. It used to be owned here, and the reason
 * given was that the Audio workspace had no monitor to hold one; it has two now.
 *
 * The space bar is answered by the monitor, not from here: a strip and a tab both listening on
 * the `sequence` scope would toggle playback twice on one press.
