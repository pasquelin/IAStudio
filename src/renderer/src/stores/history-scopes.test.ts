 * The half of the `SCOPE_BY_WORKSPACE` trap that `shared/` cannot see.

 * A store built on `createDocumentStore` records an undo history from its first `runCommand`.
 * If the workspace it serves names no scope, the native `role: 'undo'` keeps ⌘Z, the window
 * never sees the key, and no menu row can name a command — the history fills up and nothing
 * can pop it. Silent, and it has happened three times: Skyboxes, the take editor, and Materials,
 * whose manual promised ⌘Z on an applied style for as long as nothing answered.
 *
 * `command.test.ts` holds the other half — a scope named in the table declares both commands —
 * but no test there can reach this one: which stores hold a history is a fact of `renderer/`.
