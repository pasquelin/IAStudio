/**
 * How badly a picture disagrees with itself where it wraps.
 *
 * A tiled texture meets its own opposite edge: the left column sits against the right one, the
 * top row against the bottom. What a viewer reads as a seam is the size of that step compared
 * with the detail already in the picture — a noisy stone tolerates a jump that would be a scar
 * across a smooth plaster.
 *
 * So the answer is a **ratio**, not a difference: the average step across the wrap, over the
 * average step one texel inside it. One means the wrap is no worse than the picture's own
 * grain; well above one means an edge somebody will see.
