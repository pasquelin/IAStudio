/**
 * The four channels a texture can compute for itself, one shader each. Everything happens per
 * pixel on the GPU: a 4K height map is 16 million samples, and a JS loop over them is a frozen
 * window — invariant 6, first line.
 *
 * **None of them takes a strength.** Every derivation already has a live control at render
 * time — `normalScale` for the relief, `aoIntensity` for the occlusion, `roughnessRange` for
 * the remap — so the pixels are baked neutral and the material panel is what one turns. Baking
 * a strength in would freeze into a file a decision the sliders already make reversible.
