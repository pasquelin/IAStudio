/**
 * jsdom has no WebGL context, so Pixi is doubled. What is tested here is what the engine
 * *decides* — which surfaces it builds, which gesture a click starts, what it publishes — never
 * what lands on the GPU, which only a real renderer could tell.
 *
 * It exists because the alternative was believed for a while: that this file could not be tested
 * at all. A guard added to `apply` then silently stopped a freshly opened document from ever
 * building a texture, and nothing caught it.
