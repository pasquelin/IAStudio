 * millionth and two thousandths of a second per pixel. Both were once exported as `MIN_SCALE` and
 * `MAX_SCALE`, and both take and return a bare `number` — so an auto-import reaching the wrong
 * file compiled, and clamped a zoom to a unit it had never heard of.
 *
 * The names now say which. This reads BOTH sides on purpose: a claim about two ranges that only
 * ever measured one would be the costliest kind of comment — true-looking, and half-checked.
