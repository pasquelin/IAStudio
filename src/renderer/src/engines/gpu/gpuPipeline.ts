/**
 * A full-screen quad and somewhere to draw it. Every off-screen image the studio computes —
 * colour grading a sky, deriving a normal map from a height map, packing three channels into
 * one — is the same operation: one shader, one source, one destination.
 *
 * It takes the renderer it draws with rather than making one. Two WebGL contexts in one window
 * cannot exchange a texture, so anything whose result feeds the scene — a graded sky, a
 * prefiltered environment — has to be given the viewport's own, or every frame would come back
 * through the CPU, which is exactly what invariant 6 forbids.
 *
 * **One exception, and it is the shape of it that makes it one**: a pass whose result leaves as
 * a file exchanges nothing. `engines/material/derive` opens a context of its own for the length
 * of one derivation, because drawing into the viewport's would draw over the frame the user is
 * looking at. Anything that keeps its result on the GPU does not get to make that choice.
