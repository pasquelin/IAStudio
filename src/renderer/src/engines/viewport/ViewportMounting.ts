   * move the view without moving one thing a scene camera films, and those frames now composite
   * a picture already drawn instead of walking the scene a second time. Measured on a scene of
   * 1 504 nodes: the second pass cost 5,1 ms of CPU for 0,38 ms of GPU.
   *
   * Whoever owns the scene calls this — `SceneRenderer.redraw` does both at once, and a guard
   * holds it to that, because a missed call shows the wrong instant while a spare one costs a
   * single frame.
