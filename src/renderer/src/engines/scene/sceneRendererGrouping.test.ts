 * What decides whether the repeated shapes are drawn in one call or ten thousand.

 * Read as text for the reason `sceneRendererRedraw` is: the engine cannot be built without a
 * WebGL context, and this is the ABSENCE of a call — the grouping used to live inside
 * `reportStats`, past its two early returns, so it ran only while the statistics overlay was on.
 * Every gate stayed green on that: the instances were correct whenever they existed at all.
