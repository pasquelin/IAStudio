/**
 * Picking, as screen arithmetic rather than as a ray — a bone first, a rail's knobs since.
 *
 * A bone carries no geometry — it is a transform, and what a skeleton draws are lines between
 * them. Raycasting those lines answers a SEGMENT, not a named bone, and the bones of a rig cross
 * every mesh they drive, so a ray through the viewport lands on whichever one happens to be
 * behind the pointer. That is why bones were kept off the raycaster entirely.
 *
 * Projecting each bone to the screen and taking the nearest one has neither problem: it names a
 * bone directly, it never picks one hidden behind a shoulder by accident, and it is pure — which
 * is what lets it be held to account without a GPU.
