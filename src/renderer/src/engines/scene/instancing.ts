/**

 * The matrices go into a `Float32Array`, where a mesh's own are doubles — measured, that costs
 * 0.30 mm of drift at 10 000 units from the origin and 3.1 mm at 100 000, so a camera-relative
 * frame buys nothing at any distance a level reaches.
 *
 * The meshes are NOT replaced — they are moved to a layer the camera ignores. Everything that
 * reads `objects` goes on working, and what it buys was measured on this Mac at 1600×900, on
 * 10 000 shadowed spheres: a tight view fell from 12.4 ms and 9 566 draw calls to 3.7 ms and 40,
 * a wide one from 24.4 ms and 19 411 calls to 4.3 ms and 73.
