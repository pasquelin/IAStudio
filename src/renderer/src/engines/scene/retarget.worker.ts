/**
 * Wiring only, like `skinWeights.worker.ts`: everything worth reasoning about is in `retarget.ts`,
 * which needs no worker to be measured.
 *
 * What IS here and nowhere else: three's own sampling loop. `retargetClip` replays the source
 * through an `AnimationMixer` frame by frame — 240 whole poses for eight seconds at 30 fps — and
 * that is pure arithmetic with no DOM and no GPU, which is exactly what invariant 6 sends away.
