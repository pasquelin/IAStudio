/**
 * Which asset each shipped working texture became in the open project, and the material a new

 *
 * NO PRIMITIVE IS BORN BARE. A grey shape says nothing about its scale, nothing about how its
 * UVs stretch, and nothing about where one of its faces ends and the next begins — which is
 * three quarters of what a person looks at a new shape FOR. The texture is a starting point,
 * changed like any other, never an absence to be filled later.
 *
 * Module state rather than a store, for one reason: `createNodeOf` is synchronous — it runs
 * inside a command, between two entries of the history — and copying four files into a project
 * is not. `ensureCheckerTextures` is what the two doors that make shapes await first: the scene
 * space when it mounts, and the new-document flow before it seeds a template.
