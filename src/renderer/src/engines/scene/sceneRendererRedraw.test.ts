/**
 * What the camera preview's cache rests on, and what nothing else can hold.
 *
 * The engine reuses the picture it drew for the preview on every frame where what a scene camera
 * FILMS has not moved — an orbit, a fly, damping settling. Named intents say which is which:
 * `redraw` for the scene, `repaint` for the workshop drawn over it. A bare `requestRender` is
 * neither, and would leave the monitor showing an instant that is gone with nothing to notice.
 *
 * Read as text because that is the only way to see the ABSENCE of a call. The engine cannot be
 * built without a WebGL context, and a test that drove it would only ever cover the paths it
 * happened to take.
