/**
 * Draws a repeated shape through one `InstancedMesh` per CELL of the world, and turns off the
 * cells the camera cannot reach.
 *
 * `createInstancedGroups` cuts a group on a budget of TRIANGLES, which says nothing about where
 * the bodies stand: measured on a level of 500 000, 19 regions of cubes covered the whole world
 * and drew their 223 488 instances whatever the view. The grain here is spatial and fixed, so a
 * lot can never spread past one cell — 20 462 instances for the same view, and 2.26 ms of GPU
 * against 2.86.
 *
 * 🛑 A mesh is the unit of culling, and reducing the meshes costs more than it gives back:
 * measured three times, one `BatchedMesh` per lot draws 45 789 instances where this draws 20 462.
 * See RAPPORT-C5B2 § 3.
