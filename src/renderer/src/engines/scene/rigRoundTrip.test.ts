/**
 * A character made animatable, written to the open format and read back.
 *
 * The studio's 3D documents are glTF now, and a rig is the one part of a model whose meaning
 * could go missing on the way: glTF carries the skin and the joints in standard, but it has no
 * place at all for "this bone is the left elbow". Nothing writes those roles into the file, and
 * nothing needs to — the local rigger names each bone after its role, and `boneRoles` reads the
 * name back off the loaded scene. This is the test that the round trip therefore loses nothing.
