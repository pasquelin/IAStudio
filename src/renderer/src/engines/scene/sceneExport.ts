/**

 * What is exported is the objects the document describes, and nothing else: the grid, the
 * trihedron, the gizmo and the light helpers are siblings of the nodes in the viewport rather
 * than children of one, so handing over the node objects leaves them behind by construction.
 *
 * Copies are handed over rather than the objects themselves. Three reasons, all of them ones a
 * file would otherwise show: the exporters write a *local* transform, so a selected child would
 * land where it sits inside its parent rather than where it sits in the scene; `USDZExporter`
 * takes a single root, and gathering several under one would mean pulling them out of the
 * viewport mid-export; and the wireframe overlay is the one thing that really is a child of a
 * mesh, so it is dropped from the copy instead of hidden in the original.
