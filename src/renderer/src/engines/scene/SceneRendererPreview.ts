   * it would hand the montage a character a few pixels tall. The angle is a decision somebody
   * made; the distance is this function's, always.
   *
   * The camera is moved directly rather than through the orbit: a viewport drawing into a video
   * frame has no one dragging it, and the orbit's target would only be read on the next drag.
   * It asks for no render of its own, unlike `frameSelection`: its caller draws the very next
   * line, and a frame loop woken per aim would run the viewport's pass forever behind a canvas
   * nobody is looking at.
   *
   * Answers whether it actually framed SOMETHING — false while every model is still a node with
   * no file behind it, which encloses no box at all. That is what lets a caller aim once and
