 * Draws every shape wearing one material in one call, whatever the shapes are.
 *
 * One `BatchedMesh` per material instead of one `InstancedMesh` per (geometry, material): the
 * lot holds every geometry of its members in a single buffer and culls and sorts per instance,
 * so a scene of three shapes and eight paints is eight calls where it was twenty-four groups.
 *
 * The meshes are NOT replaced — they are moved to a layer the camera ignores, exactly as
 * `createInstancedGroups` does, so everything that reads `objects` goes on working.
 *
 * 🛑 Measured on this Mac, 2026-09-02, on the real engine: the lot costs MORE CPU than the
 * instance on every scene — three walks every instance of every lot on every pass to cull and
 * sort it, 10.4 ms against 3.1 a frame on 10 000 bodies with one shadow. See RAPPORT-C1.
