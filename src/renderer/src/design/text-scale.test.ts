 * step the stylesheet has not re-valued: those are `rem`, and `rem` answers to the root element,
 * which nothing here sizes. That is how 95 of the 131 sized elements came to ignore the
 * preference for as long as it existed.
 *
 * What this cannot see: text PAINTED rather than laid out — `context.font` in the canvas and
 * timeline engines, a `fontSize` handed to a chart. Those are pixels in a string or a number,
 * not a class, and they read the tokens through `engines/core/palette.ts` or not at all.
