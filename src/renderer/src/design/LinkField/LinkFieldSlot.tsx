 * up on a drag it has no use for. `exclusive`, because these slots sit inside the panel's own
 * target — without it both would frame at once and the answer would name two places.
 *
 * NOT `AssetDropField`, whose name is one letter away: that one is a form control — it registers
 * with react-hook-form, draws an input, and holds the chosen id itself. This holds nothing.
