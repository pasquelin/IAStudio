 * The stack, flattened to one picture — the half of an export that has nothing to do with where it
 * lands. Composited by the GPU on the way out, the same pass the screen shows, so what is written
 * is what was judged.
 *
 * `flatten`, not `snapshot`: this writer takes BYTES, and the port has had both all along. Going
 * through base64 encoded the whole picture to a string and decoded it back one closure per byte —
 * for a 20 MB PNG, twenty million calls and three copies of it in memory, to reach a field that
 * never wanted a string.
