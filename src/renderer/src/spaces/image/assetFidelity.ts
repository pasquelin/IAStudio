 * Says it when a document no longer measures the asset it edits — and says nothing else.

 * NOT a refusal, and the difference is the whole decision: a crop is an edit like any other, so
 * a save that declined a resized document would be an image editor that cannot crop. That was
 * tried, and it refused five saves in a row before being removed.
 *
 * What it replaces is the SILENCE that removal left behind. ⌘S overwrites the asset's file at
 * the document's size, and `replaceBytes` deletes what it replaces — so a document that drifted
 * without anyone meaning it to shrinks the original with nothing said. It happened: a
 * 4112 × 2658 photo opened into a 1024² document was written back over itself at 1024².
 *
 * Said at both moments it can still be acted on — reopening the tab, and the save itself.
 *
 * The name is passed rather than the asset: one caller holds the shelf row and the other holds
 * only what ⌘S was given, and the id and the name are all either of them needs to say it.
