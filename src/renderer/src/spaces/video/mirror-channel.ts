 * What the studio publishes to the video return, and how.

 * A `BroadcastChannel` and not the IPC bridge, which would be the reflex here: every window of
 * the studio loads the SAME renderer bundle, so both ends already share `SequenceState` as a
 * type. Routing it through the main process would mean restating that type in `shared/`, where
 * it does not belong — a sequence is the video space's own shape, and the main process has no
 * use for one. The bridge keeps what only it can do: opening the window.
 *
 * Two kinds of message rather than one, and the split is what keeps it cheap:
 *
 * - `edit` carries the whole sequence, and only when the edit itself changes. It is the big one.
 * - `time` carries a number, and is sent for every playhead move — a scrub is a few hundred of
 *   those a second, and each would otherwise re-post every track and every clip.
 *
 * Playback is NOT streamed frame by frame: `playing` tells the return to run its own transport
 * from the time it already has. A message per frame would put the return one IPC hop behind the
 * picture it is meant to mirror, and would still drift.
