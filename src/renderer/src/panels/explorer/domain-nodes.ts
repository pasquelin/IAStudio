 *
 * The two halves come back APART: the headings keep the order `FILE_DOMAINS` declares, which is
 * the order the shelf and the rail already use, while the files are the caller's to sort — a
 * sort of file names has nothing to say about which domain comes first. A domain nothing is
 * filed under is left out rather than drawn empty: the view answers what the project holds, and
 * seven headings over an empty project say nothing at all.
 *
 * The files are `FolderNode`s, `name` included, and that is deliberate: the rows are drawn by
 * the same reading the file tree uses — the document behind a file is found by its FILE name,
 * so an item named after its document's title would find nothing.
