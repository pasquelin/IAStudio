 * one RENAMES it — a project is named by its folder — and one drops it from the shelf. Reopening
 * the project puts a forgotten row back, which is what makes the last row safe with no
 * confirmation behind it.
 *
 * `onRename` is optional so the menu can be offered where no field can open; the rename is the one
