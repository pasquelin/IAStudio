 * not React, not Electron, and not a node builtin a browser has never had. What a host needs
 * from the studio arrives as a PARAMETER, which is why `host/` gets no exception here.
 *

 * are green on `import { useScenes } from '@/stores/scenes'` written inside `src/game`. Knip does
 * report an unused export of this tree — measured 2026-08-26, and not what the audit expected —
 * but it says nothing about where an import comes FROM.

 * Suites are swept along with the sources: a test that reaches into the studio drags the whole
 * of it into a tree whose point is not to need it.
