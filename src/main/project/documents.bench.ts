/**
 * What one save and one open cost the main process.
 *
 * The scene stopped being free the day it became glTF: writing one PARSES the whole body and
 * writes it back indented, to stamp the title into the field a reader shows. Measured 18/08 —
 * 19 ms at 5 000 nodes and 190 ms at 50 000, against 9 and 88 for the envelope it replaced. The
 * montage pays the same price for the same reason, on a body an order of magnitude smaller.
 *
 * The comparison is the point of keeping this: `stringify` of the whole file is measured beside
 * it, and it is what the main thread used to pay per save. A main thread busy for more than
 * 16 ms freezes every window of the studio, detached ones included — CLAUDE.md, invariant 6.
 * `node:v8` is the serializer Electron's IPC uses.
 *
 * `createDocumentFiles` itself is not called: what is measured is its synchronous half, and the
 * `writeFile`/`rename` around it are asynchronous and off the JS thread.

 * What listing a project of 2 000 documents across 200 folders costs, three ways.
 *
 * This is the measure that decides how `list()` is written, and it is here rather than argued
 * about: the walk opens the head of every candidate, so the question is whether the opens have
 * to be spread over a pool and whether a `stat` cache is worth the second syscall it adds. A
 * main thread busy for more than 16 ms freezes every window — CLAUDE.md, invariant 6 — but this
 * runs off the thread's critical path, so the number that matters is how long a reader waits.
 *
 * Written on a temporary folder rather than mocked: what is being compared is syscall shape, and
 * a mock would compare nothing.
 *
 * **Measured 2026-08-18** (macOS, APFS, Node 24): 151 ms one at a time, 55 ms over a pool of 16,
 * 20 ms when every head is answered from the cache. The same three read 279 / 143 / 45 beside
 * four other sessions, and 117 / 35 / 19 the day before: the SHAPE holds across all three runs,
 * the absolute numbers are worth what the machine's load makes them.
 *
 * **The conclusion once drawn from these three — that a cache does not pay — was wrong twice
 * over.** It saves 35 ms of the 55 even here, and here is the CHEAP case: these files carry an
 * enveloped head followed by four thousand `x`, where a scene the studio writes is a glTF whose
 * head is the whole file parsed. The group below measures that one.
