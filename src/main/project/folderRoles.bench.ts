/**
 * What opening a project costs the main process, on projects the size of real ones. A main thread
 * busy for more than 16 ms freezes every window of the studio — CLAUDE.md, invariant 6.
 *
 * `folder.ts` is measured here rather than beside itself: the walk and the listing read the very
 * shapes the roles are resolved against, and laying 300 000 files down twice would buy nothing.
 *
 * **Measured 2026-08-28** (macOS, APFS, M2 Pro, Node 24.8), mean, before the descent refusal and
 * after it. Opening with no cache: 16.30 → 6.84 at 10 000 assets, 86.76 → 61.01 at 100 000,
 * 232.99 → 6.64 on the checkout. The save walk: 142.57 → 8.16 on the checkout, and unchanged on
 * the two media shapes, which hold no packages — the mechanism is narrow, and that is the proof.
 *
 * **Still over budget, and NOT a defect of this walk**: 100 000 entries cost ~50 ms to cross
 * whatever the predicate says. A project that size wants the walk off this thread.
 *
 * Read the RATIOS, not the absolutes: a second run beside four other sessions read 8.99 where the
 * one above read 6.64, and the shape held.
