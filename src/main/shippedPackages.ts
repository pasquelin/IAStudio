/**
 * The npm packages that reach a user's disk: bundled by Vite, loaded at runtime, or shipped
 * beside. Not here on purpose: eslint, prettier, vitest, electron-builder and the `@types` — a
 * build tool never leaves the machine that ran it. `typescript` is the exception, see below.
 *
 * Spelled out rather than derived from `dependencies`: this project bundles React, zustand,
 * dockview and the rest with Vite, so they sit in `devDependencies` while shipping in the binary
 * all the same. Deriving from the manifest would quietly omit most of the notice.
 *
 * Under `src/main` rather than `src/shared`: it describes what the repository root ships, and
 * `src/shared` compiles for the renderer, which has no use for the list. Nothing
 * of the application imports it — `scripts/collect-licences.mjs` does, and so does
 * `licences.test.ts`, so the list the tests check is the one the collector reads.

/**
 * The other half of the same partition: declared, never shipped. They run on the machine that
 * builds and never reach a user, so the notice owes them nothing.
 *
 * Beside `SHIPPED` rather than in the suite that reads it, and that is the whole point: the two
 * lists are one decision written twice, and they lived in different folders — a package added to
 * the manifest had to be classified in `src/main` or in a test of `src/shared`, and whoever added
 * it saw only one of the two. `licences.test.ts` confronts them with the manifest.
 *
 * Neither list is DERIVED from the other, and that is deliberate: a new dependency belongs to
 * neither until someone says which, and the red is what asks. Deriving one would make the answer
 * "build tool" by default — silently, for a package that may well ship.
