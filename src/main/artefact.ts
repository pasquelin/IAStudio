/**
 * What it means for a build to ship the same bytes twice.
 *
 * No test of the suite can see this: a duplicate is made by the bundler, out of files no import
 * graph reaches. `eager-graph.test.ts` walks the static imports from the entry point and is blind
 * to it by construction — the decoders that made this necessary arrived one from
 * `copy-decoders.mjs`, outside every import, and one from three.js's own `new URL('../libs/…')`.
 *
 * The rule lives here rather than in the script that launches it: a rule kept inside its launcher
 * is a rule no test can reach, and a walk that returns nothing then reads exactly like a clean
 * artefact.
 *
 * It sees one class of waste and not the other. Of the 1 899 658 bytes this lot removed, it would
 * have caught 835 738 — the four byte-identical twins. The rest had no twin at all, and it is
 * `decoderUrls.test.ts`, inside `pnpm validate`, that keeps those from coming back.
