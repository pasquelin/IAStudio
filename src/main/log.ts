/**
 * The main process's own log. It prints to the terminal running the app, records to a rotating
 * file in every build, and — once the mirror is installed — reaches every renderer's devtools.
 *
 * The mirror is the point: the API calls leave from the main process, so they never appear in
 * the renderer's Network tab, and every failure crossing the boundary is reduced to a code —
 * an SDK error message embeds the request that produced it, so it carries the API key and can
 * never reach the renderer. That reduction leaves "unexpected" as the only thing a user sees;
 * this is where the rest of the story stays.
 *
 * Never log a whole SDK error: log its status and its parsed body, which the credentials never
 * travel in — see `describeFailure`.
