/**
 * `openMemoryDatabase` hands out a native handle, and a suite that drops it never gives it back.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-14: fourteen openings across the five catalogue suites, zero teardowns.
 * `node:sqlite` is experimental and its handles are finalised by the garbage collector at a time
 * nobody chooses, so a leak here is not a tidiness question — it leaves twelve worker processes
 * holding databases nothing will ask for again.
 *
 * **Matched by NAME, and read off the TREE.** Two earlier drafts were shown green on a real leak:
 * one counted teardowns without reading whose they were, so closing a server answered for a
 * database; the next read the argument as text, so a comment explaining why the handle was left
 * open absolved it. The handle's own name has to come back, spelt as code.
 *
 * FOUR blind spots, written down rather than left to be found:
 *
 * - **the SUITES are read, and nothing else.** A fixture is not a `.test.ts`, so a third wrapper
 *   around `openMemoryDatabase` would open databases this guard never sees. `OPENERS` is the whole
 *   of what it knows, and it is a list somebody has to extend by hand — `memoryCatalog` was
 *   missing from it until 2026-08-14, which hid eight leaks.
 * - **named, not invoked.** `onTestFinished(() => { if (keep) d.close() })` gives the handle back
 *   on one branch and reads as sound on both: the rule sees the name spelt as code, never the call
 *   actually made. Following the branch would need the value resolved, which no reader does by eye.
 * - **a name, not a binding.** Two handles sharing a name share their tally. The case that gets
 *   through is a teardown posted in one `describe` for a handle opened elsewhere under the same
 *   name. Resolving scopes buys a rule no reader could apply by eye.
 * - **three correct spellings it refuses**, all erring towards the safe side and none in the tree:
 *   `const { close } = openMemoryDatabase()`, a handle renamed before its teardown, and a handle
 *   handed to a helper that closes it. Each reads as a leak.
