 * BSD-3-Clause AND BSL-1.0 AND MIT`, and `numpy` is a composition of five. What states them is
 * each package's own `METADATA`, read by `scripts/collect-python-licences.mjs` into
 * `engine/licences.json` and committed — materialising the environment costs 682 Mo, and neither
 * the gate nor a clone should pay it to produce a notice.
 *
 * What lives here is the half a file cannot answer: which packages reach a person at all.
