/**
 * The main process fills a translation's `{{holes}}` in one place, and `String.replace` is not it.
 *
 * The window has i18next. This side reads `TRANSLATIONS[language]` straight and used to fill by
 * hand, four sites and four shapes: `replace('{{title}}', …)`, `replace('{{name}}', …)`, two of
 * those chained, and `replace(/\{\{size\}\}/g, …)`. The last one is the whole argument — a literal
 * first argument rewrites the FIRST match only, `skyboxFaceSize` is `{{size}} × {{size}}` in both
 * bundles, and that site had to be respelled with a regular expression once someone saw the second
 * one standing in a menu. The other three were one translator away from the same defect: repeating
 * a name inside a sentence is ordinary language, not a mistake, and no test named the risk.
 *
 * `fillHoles` (`shared/i18n`) fills every occurrence of every hole it is handed. This refuses the
 * SHAPE that made the defect possible — which is less than refusing the defect, and the batch's
 * adversarial review measured exactly how much less.
 *
 * THREE blind spots, written rather than left to be found:
 *
 * - **the pattern has to be a literal AT the call.** Measured as invisible here, and the first two
 *   reintroduce the original defect in full: `const HOLE = '{{name}}'` then `text.replace(HOLE, n)`
 *   · `text.replace(new RegExp('\\{\\{name\\}\\}'), n)`, which without `g` also rewrites one match
 *   · a template literal WITH a substitution, `` `{{${key}}}` `` · `` String.raw`{{name}}` ``.
 *   Closing them needs to know what an identifier holds, which one file at a time cannot say.
 * - **a hole nobody FILLS is a different defect, and no shape betrays it** — the call is simply
 *   not written. Only output catches that: `menu/template.test.ts` sweeps every label of every
 *   submenu in both languages, `project/documentDialogs.test.ts` reads the message it builds, and
 *   `project/handlers.test.ts` reads the name an extracted texture is written under.
 * - **the receiver is not typed, and `{{` is not always a translation.** `s.replace('{{', '')` —
 *   stripping braces, which a bundle tool or the pseudo-locale would do — is reported, as is a
 *   `replace` on something that is not a string. Nothing in `src/main` writes either, and the rule
 *   reads the method's name exactly as `no-bare-locale-compare.test.ts` reads `sort`.
