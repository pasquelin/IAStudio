/**
 * The 233 tools, exercised BY A CLIENT rather than read from the module that builds them.
 *
 * The gap this closes, measured on 2026-08-26: `runConfirmedAction` was driven 233 times by the
 * bench and `tools/call` not once. Every action was proven; nothing proved that what carries it
 * is a protocol a client can speak. A tool whose schema a client refuses to parse, a name that no
 * longer finds its action back, a `required` naming a parameter nobody declares — all three leave
 * the typecheck, the lint and the suite green.
 *
 * Driven by the SDK's own `Client`, which is the point: its schemas are what every client on the
 * machine validates the answer against, so this asserts the contract rather than our reading of it.
