/**
 * Electron in a bottle, for main-process tests — four of them had grown their own copy of
 * `ipcMain`, so any change to `handle()` meant four edits.
 *
 * The registries are module singletons because `vi.mock` factories are hoisted above imports: a
 * const declared in the test file would still be in its temporal dead zone when the factory
 * runs. The test mocks with `async () => (await import(…)).mockElectron()`, whose dynamic
 * import resolves at call time, and reads back the same registries through its own import.
 *
 * The types below describe the DOUBLE, not Electron: the module under test is compiled against
 * the real declarations, and `vi.mock` only ever swaps what runs. That is what lets a listener
 * be typed by what this file hands it rather than by an overload it cannot satisfy.
