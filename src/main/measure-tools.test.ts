/**
 * The two detectors that answer a question no other gate asks: what is dead, and what is written
 * twice. knip judges — fifth link of `pnpm validate` since 2026-08-17 — while jscpd only reports;
 * either way **nothing else in the suite goes red the day one of them is quietly turned off**,
 * which is why these cases exist. The same reasoning as `gate-caches.test.ts`, one file over.
 *
 * A detector reads its own config file, and every way of blinding one ends in the same place: it
 * reports zero and looks like good news. A raised token floor, a path that no longer names `src`,
 * an ignore that swallows the tree — each is one line, and each turns a measurement into a green
 * tick nobody can tell from a clean repository.
 *
 * Under `src/main` rather than `src/shared`: these files sit at the repository root, and
 * `src/shared` compiles for the renderer, which cannot read a disk.
