 * catalogue, so it goes through the client, the rate limiter, the retries and the cost meter the
 * studio already has — and it needs no second account, no second key, and nothing new in the
 * settings the user has to fill in before the assistant works at all.
 *
 * What it does not have, and what this file therefore carries: no tool use, so the catalogue of
 * actions is described in the instruction and the answer is parsed back out of text; no
 * conversation, so history goes in `textInputs`, ten blocks at most; and no streaming, so the
 * answer arrives whole, after a job.
