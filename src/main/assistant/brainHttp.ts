 * The window a chat cloud is taken to hold — an ASSUMPTION, said as one: the model here is TYPED
 * BY HAND and none of these clouds publishes its window over the API, so the defaults bound
 * nothing. What degrades when it is wrong is `CLOUD_FALLBACK_TOKENS`, one round trip.
 *
 * 🛑 `[M]` It was 32 000, which gave `roomFor` 90 828 characters against a catalogue costing
 * 90 994 — the state, the context and the folders were all cut to fit it. Measured 2026-08-31 on
 * the 437 scenarios of `pnpm banc` against deepseek-chat: 55% → 61% passed, 2 069 → 1 548 rounds,
 * 496 → 269 refusals.
 *
 * 🛑 That catalogue is GONE — the briefing now carries names and the manuals a chain opens, and
 * the widest one reachable runs 23 607 characters. Nothing is cut above 8 192 tokens, so this
 * number no longer constrains anything: it is what the door ASKS for, not what it needs.
 *
 * 🛑 It budgets the BRIEFING and nothing else: `messagesFor` sends the history unbounded, where
 * `brainLocal` trims it through `promptWindow`. Ten blocks and a paste can add 110 020 characters
 * — a real overrun comes back a 400 and `readOrNarrow` answers it, which is why it costs a round
 * trip rather than the turn.

 * briefing is composed against everywhere else. Through `roomFor` like the other two doors: the
 * reply and the sentence get their room from the same arithmetic, rather than from a number
 * written here that reserved neither.
 *
 * 🛑 `[M]` It was 4 096 — an Ollama TAG's figure, on a door no Ollama model reaches — leaving the
 * briefing 7 116 characters against a catalogue costing 7 098: eighteen of margin, and the folders
 * block dropped whole. No chat cloud here holds under 8 192.
