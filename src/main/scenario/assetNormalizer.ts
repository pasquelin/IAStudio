 * Turning an API asset into one the studio can show, from either of the two shapes it arrives in.
 *
 * There are two because `GET /assets` and `POST /search/assets` do not answer with the same
 * record: a search hit has no `kind`, no `properties`, no `status` and no `editCapabilities`,
 * and carries a `teamId` and a `score` instead. Neither is a subset of the other, so one reader
 * would have to treat half its fields as optional and lose the ability to say what is missing.
 *
 * Everything is read defensively. This is an API response, and the alternative to a guard is a
 * crash in the main process on a field that arrived one shape different.
