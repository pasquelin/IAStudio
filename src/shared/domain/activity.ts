 *
 * A line stores a KEY and its parameters, never a sentence. A sentence written in French into

 *
 * `detail` carries `describeFailure` and nothing else. An SDK error message embeds the request
 * that produced it, so it carries the `Authorization` header, so it carries the API key — see
 * `scenario/client.ts`. A journal is a file on disk that a user may well send to someone.
