/**
 * The four working textures the app ships with — a grid and a checker, each at two densities.
 *
 * What they are FOR: judging scale, seeing UVs stretch, and telling one face of a primitive from
 * another. Every modelling package ships something like them, and a grey primitive tells none of
 * those three things.
 *
 * One tile is ONE METRE, which is what makes `tilesPerMetre` mean what it says: at a density of
 * one, a square of `gridLarge` measures a metre on the floor it is laid on.
 *
 * They are ordinary PNG files under `resources/textures`, copied into the project the first time
 * a scene wants one and referenced like any other asset from then on. Not a texture the engine
 * invents: a document holds an asset id, and a `.gltf` has to point at an image that exists.
