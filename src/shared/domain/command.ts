 * not COMPILE until someone answers the question for it — `Partial` let all four slip through.
 *
 * Which of them holds a history is a fact of `renderer/`, invisible from here, so the other half
 * of the guard sits there: `renderer/src/stores/history-scopes.test.ts` walks the document
 * stores and fails on the next one that grows a history while its workspace answers `null`.
