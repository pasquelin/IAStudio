/**
 * Whether an action may run without the question on screen.
 *
 * The one piece of the delegation that decides anything, and it is pure: what it answers has to be
 * checkable without a window, because what it answers is whether a machine may spend somebody's
 * money while they are not looking.
 *
 * 🛑 It is no longer the only door. A call from the wire that this refuses comes back with a
 * consent token, and the same call sent back with it runs — see `wireConsent.ts`. What the two
 * doors share is the ledger: a spend passed by token is debited here too, or a ceiling armed on
 * one door would be spent through the other.
 *
 * Three rules, and none of them is a convenience:
 *
 * - Nothing is delegated unless the person armed it. Every field defaults to off or to zero.
 * - A spend the API declined to PRICE is never delegated, whatever the budget holds. An unknown
 *   cost is an unbounded one, and a ceiling cannot bound it.
 * - The budget is what is left, not what was set: it is measured against what this window has
 *   already spent unasked, so ten calls of one unit each are ten units and not one.
