/**
 * Reconciling a stored order with the registry this build declares. The bar of spaces and the
 * home's bands both need it, and both had written it out — the subtle half, where a newcomer
 * belongs, twice.
 *
 * A stored order is a photograph of what existed the day it was written: an entry since dropped
 * would draw a hole, and one since added would be invisible to everyone who had already arranged
 * theirs. So a newcomer lands where the registry declares it — right after the last of its
 * earlier neighbours the reader kept — rather than at the end, and the reason the registry is
 * ordered survives.
 *
 * `kept` is the stored order already cleaned of what this build no longer knows: only the caller
 * can say what a valid entry is, and it is the same pass that drops the malformed ones.
