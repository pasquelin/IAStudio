 * - `none` — undoable, and nothing outlives the window.
 * - `files` — moves, renames or bins something in the project folder, or drops unsaved work.
 *   The Explorer can undo it, but the disk has already changed and another program may have
 *   read it since.
 * - `asset` — uploads a picture, which becomes a permanent asset in the user's library.
 * - `remote` — publishes to a server outside this machine. Costs nothing and destroys nothing
 *   locally, and that is exactly why the other levels do not describe it: what leaves cannot be
 *   called back, and no undo on this machine reaches it.
 * - `studio` — changes what the studio IS beyond the open document: which preferences hold,
 *   which account answers, which project is open. No ⌘Z reaches any of it, and the account is
 *   the one that decides whose library and whose invoice the next generation lands on. It is the
 *   only level with no delegation switch, and that is the point.
 * - `credits` — spends real money. Confirmed, and the estimate is stated first.
 *
 * The distinction matters at the moment of asking: only `credits` has a figure to quote, and
 * inventing one for the others would be worse than admitting there is none.
 *
 * `files` is deliberately narrow — destroying, moving or renaming — and NOT "anything that
 * writes". A new folder and a duplicate add something nobody loses, and a studio that asked
 * about those would teach its user to click Allow without reading.
