 * asset type is a kind of bytes the studio generates and files. Nothing generates a material.
 *
 * `other` is not a failure to classify. A project folder is the user's own, and a `.pdf` of
 * storyboard notes sitting beside the rushes is a file the explorer shows and the studio leaves
 * alone — there is no domain to file it under, and inventing one would be worse than saying so.

 * picture, so a project could not be arranged any other way without the studio losing track of
 * what it held. With the tree open, nothing about a path can say what a file is any more.
 *
 * **No SOURCE extension reaches `texture` or `skybox`, and that is deliberate.** There is no such
 * thing as a texture file: there are PNGs, and a material document that gives some of them a part
 * to play — that document is an edit, and it is what carries those two domains. Guessing from a
 * suffix or a folder name would be right often and wrong silently: a normal map and an albedo
 * are both PNGs. A source takes those domains by being referenced, or by the user saying so; the
