 * under the studio's key; nothing about the extension can say.
 *
 * **Two `extras`, and they are not interchangeable.** The ENVELOPE goes in `asset.extras` because
 * `asset` is written first and on one line, so a listing reads a document's identity out of the
 * head of the file without inflating the rest of it. The STATE goes in the root `extras`, where it
 * may weigh whatever it weighs. The specification reserves both for exactly this: § 3.5 says an
 * `extras` property "MAY be defined on any glTF object" and that clients ignore what they do not
 * understand.
