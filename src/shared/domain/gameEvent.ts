/**
 * A closed union, like `ActionName` and `ComponentType`: the compiler holds the list, MCP
 * publishes it, Monaco completes it, and the timeline offers it. `Custom` is the escape hatch and
 * carries its name as DATA rather than widening the union.
 *
 * In `shared/` rather than beside the bus that carries it: a component descriptor declares what it
 * EMITS, and a descriptor is read by the window, by the main process and by the runtime alike —
 * three trees, of which only `shared` sits below all three.
 *
 * 🛑 Declared before they are all emitted — a name here is a contract with a script author, and
 * one added later than the surface that offers it is a name nobody can bind to.
