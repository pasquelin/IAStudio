 *
 * `scene.render` said `Rendu vidéo` / `Video render` for a year. A neutral noun phrase, the only
 * one of the twenty-nine, announcing nothing at the exact moment a render had just died. The
 * guard above it saw nothing: `DYNAMIC_KEYS` asks that the key EXISTS and is not blank, never
 * what it says.
 *
 * The wordings are listed rather than pattern-matched, because no cheap test tells a failure
 * sentence from a title. Two alternatives were measured and dropped: a value colliding with an
 * action label catches nothing (`animation.render` reads `Rendre en vidéo`, no collision at all),
 * and a minimum word count is arbitrary. Listing them costs one line the day a new phrasing is
 * written — the same upkeep `DYNAMIC_KEYS` already asks for, and an added line is a line a
 * reviewer reads.
 *
 * What this does NOT catch, and it is the important half: whether the sentence is TRUE.
 * `assets.open` used to say `Cet asset n'a nulle part où aller` and passed here, while covering
 * one of the six causes that raised it — two of which were not failures to open at all. It took
 * splitting the scope to fix, and this guard was green throughout. Announcing a failure and
 * describing the right one are two different jobs; only the first is machine work.
 *
 * Nor does the second test catch a wording made too WIDE — `/./` would pass both tests and empty
 * the guard in one line. It rules out dead entries, not dilution: "can only shrink" is about the
 * list growing into a catalogue, and says nothing about a regex that stopped being specific.
 *
 * And the list is a GRAMMAR, which is the price paid here: `Impossible de…`, `Échec de…` and
 * `Failed to…` are all correct French and English, and none of them can be pre-authorised —
 * the second test drops any wording no line uses yet. A new phrasing is a line added under a
 * reviewer's eyes, deliberately, rather than a sentence that quietly announces nothing.
