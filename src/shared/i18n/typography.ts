 * The symbols the studio writes after a number, and nothing else, per language.
 *
 * A WORD is not one: French writes `2 derniers`, `3 assets`, `24 étapes`, and that space may
 * break — some fifty of them do. Telling `Mo` from `au` is what needs a list, and it is why this
 * one is written out rather than derived. A new unit goes in here, with the value that introduced
 * it.
 *
 * `o`, `Kio`, `Mio` and `Gio` are here for the day a bundle writes one, and a review measured that
 * none can arrive by that road today: `units.*` holds the bare symbols, and it is `formatBytes`
 * that joins them to the figure. That join is in CODE, so no guard reading French values can see
 * it — which is why it binds with `NO_BREAK_SPACE` rather than trusting this list.
 *
 * English carries the byte family for the same reason, and the two lists must MIRROR each other:
 * a list holding `Mio` and not `MiB` reddens on a French value while its English twin passes, and
 * the two bundles drift apart in typography with nothing to say so. What English does not carry
 * is a word — `8 asset`, `3 days`, `24 hours` — which the boundary already lets through.
