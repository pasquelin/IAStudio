/**
 * The source bundle, split by functional surface. One flat file was the most contested path of
 * the repository — nearly a fifth of the commits touched it — so two branches working on
 * different spaces used to collide on every merge.
 *
 * The sections are merged back into one object on purpose: the studio has a single namespace,
 * and every locale is type-checked against this shape. Splitting the storage must not split the
 * contract.
