 * 61, and the trash dialog printed `Ces {{count, number}} éléments` on a screen.
 *
 * Every OTHER format is still left whole — `{{value, number(maximumFractionDigits: 1)}}` and
 * whatever comes next — as is a hole named with a dot or a dash. Guessing is worse than standing
 * out, and `main/no-unfilled-placeholder.test.ts` names the one main file that reaches a
