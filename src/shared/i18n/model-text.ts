/**
 * What a model wrote about itself, said in the studio's language.
 *
 * The generation form is built from `GET /models/{modelId}` — invariant 5 — and Scenario answers
 * in English only: no `Accept-Language`, no locale parameter, nothing in the SDK. So the labels,
 * the descriptions and the group headings are translated here or not at all.
 *
 * Keyed by the English text rather than by the field's `key`, because half of what the panel
 * shows is a sentence the model chose, not a field name: keying on `key` would translate
 * `Max splat points` and leave its description in English right below it.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is that a wording changed on Scenario's side falls back to English
 * instead of failing loudly. `normalizeModelText` absorbs the edits that cost nothing to absorb —
 * case, spacing, typographic punctuation — and the fallback is the English sentence itself, so
 * the worst case is the panel we already had.
 *
 * A word stays in English only where no surface and no glossary entry names it in French.
 * `KEPT_IN_ENGLISH`, in `model-text.i18n.test.ts`, holds that list and is what decides.
