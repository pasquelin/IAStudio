"""
What the engine answers about memory — ADR-19 R1: a probe never admits a job, a runtime reading
does. If the engine cannot answer here, every verdict falls to `unknown` and admission stops
admitting.

The core holds no tensor library, so it holds no number of its own: it composes what each DOOR
reported. A door that never answered is absent rather than zero — the difference between "it holds
nothing" and "nobody asked" is what R1 is about.
