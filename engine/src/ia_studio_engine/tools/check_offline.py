"""
Proves that a model marked "installed" generates without a network — as a PROPERTY, not a label.

🛑 `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` is NOT a proof and is deliberately not used as one: it shows that the
library reading it obeys it, never that nothing left the machine. A third-party package, a direct
`urllib`, a telemetry call that does not read it — all three go straight through.

What this does instead is CUT: every socket-creating entry point of the interpreter is replaced
by one that raises, so an attempt fails loudly with the address it wanted rather than succeeding
in silence. Eight families of implicit download are what it is looking for (spec § L.6): the
tokenizer, the pipeline config, the scheduler config, a VAE or a text encoder living in another
repository, secondary weights a pipeline resolves for itself, custom code, a runtime dependency
pulled at first import, and telemetry.

`[?]` The cut is **in-process**. It holds for anything the interpreter opens itself, which is
every case above; it does NOT hold for a subprocess or for a native library that opens its own
socket without going through Python. A container or a firewall would close that gap, and neither
works the same on the three operating systems — which is why this file says what it covers rather
than claiming to cover everything.
