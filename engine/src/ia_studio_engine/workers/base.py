"""
What every worker is: a process that answers the engine over an inherited socket, pays the import
cost of its backend ONCE, and **keeps reading while a job runs**.

That last part is the whole shape of this file. A denoise holds the interpreter for seconds; a
worker that ran it on its reading thread would not see a cancel, a status or an unload until the
job it was asked to stop had finished — which is invariant 6 of `CLAUDE.md` broken in the one place
it matters most.
