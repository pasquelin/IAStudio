"""
Our code, translating the studio's contract into a Diffusers pipeline. It is not the deserialisation
path — that is `loader`, one level below — and it applies no admission policy: the request it is
given was already admitted by the main process, and it refuses anything else as malformed.

Three refusals are wired here rather than trusted to a default, and each was measured on
2026-08-22 (spec § I.2): `use_safetensors=True` refuses instead of falling back to a pickle ·
`torch.load` has refused pickles by default since PyTorch 2.6 · and `trust_remote_code` does NOT
guard a local folder whose architecture Transformers knows, so passing `False` is necessary and
never sufficient — what protects is the manifest listing every file that reaches the disk.
