 * of them started timing out at five seconds as the suite grew, and neither was slow for a
 * reason anyone could act on. Long enough to tell a busy machine from a wedged test.
 *
 * Named because every project below has to repeat it: a project inherits nothing from the root
 * `test` block, so the value written once governed nothing.

/**
 * The zone every suite reads its clocks in, so a date test answers the same everywhere.
 *
 * Left to the machine, a test about time passes for whoever wrote it and fails for the next reader.
 * Measured before fixing it: the whole suite is green under `UTC` and under `Asia/Tokyo` alike.
 *
 * **What depends on this pin is any case asserting a LOCAL reading**, not a number of them: this
 * paragraph said "exactly one case" and a review counted three, across two files. A count drifts
 * the moment another case leans on the pin, and it sends the next reader to the wrong file.
 *
 * Tokyo rather than UTC, and rather than Paris. **Not UTC**: a zone at zero offset makes every
 * assertion about zones agree by accident, which is the defect the case above exists to catch.
 * **Not Paris**: it observes daylight saving, so a stamp near midnight changes day twice a year
 * and a suite green in August goes red in November. `Asia/Tokyo` is UTC+9 all year.
 *
 * **Set on this process, NOT through a project's `env` block** — measured, and the difference is
 * the whole reason this paragraph exists. `env: { TZ }` reaches the worker after Node has already
 * resolved its zone, so the case above still read the machine's and still failed under `TZ=UTC`.
 * Assigning it here runs while the config is evaluated, before any worker is spawned, so every
 * pool inherits it.

/**
 * Worker threads, where Vitest defaults to child processes since its version 2. What it buys is the
 * start of each worker: a process costs more than a thread, and this suite pays that once per
 * worker either way.
 *
 * Two paired series on 2026-08-12, CPU (user+sys), and they DISAGREE on how much:
 *
 *   under load ~110 : 400 s → 347 s   (−13 %)
 *   under load ~40  : 486 s → 447 s   (−8 %)
 *
 * The direction held in both and in every pair; the size did not. Read this as "somewhere between
 * eight and thirteen percent, on a machine shared with other work" rather than as a figure — a
 * single number here would be the one a later reader trusts.
 *
 * `forks` is what a native module that is not thread-safe demands, and ONE such module is reached
 * by the suites: `node:sqlite`. It is a native binding like any other, experimental at that — the
 * first `pnpm validate` with threads on all three projects ended in SIGSEGV. `better-sqlite3` is
 * NOT the one: only `sqliteNative.ts` imports it, which only `catalogWorker` loads. The
 * dictation addon sits behind a `utilityProcess` no test starts.
 *
 * Hence `forks` on the `node` project alone. Its effect is what a review measured, and it is the
 * mechanism rather than the crash: counting the PIDs that log `ExperimentalWarning: SQLite`, the
 * twelve loads happen in TWELVE processes here, against ONE process on twelve threads when all
 * projects use threads. **It does NOT prevent the crash, and that is now measured rather than
 * doubted**: on 2026-08-13, one whole-suite run in fifty ended in `EXIT=139` — SIGSEGV, twelve
 * processes killed mid-flight, no summary printed. Cumulative rate under the parade: **1 in 81**.
 * An insurance, not a fix.
 *
 * **What the hunt for it established, so that nobody pays for it twice** — two series of 25 runs,
 * one crash in the first, none in the second:
 * - macOS wrote **no crash report** for it (`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`, empty at that
 *   minute while `node` reports from other days sit right there). There is no stack to read.
 * - `node:sqlite` is the suspect the paragraph above names, and nothing measured incriminates it.
 *   Its warnings were the only thing on screen because **nothing else prints before the summary**,
 *   which designates it no more than any other module.
 * - The concrete hypothesis was tested and is dead: 500 `DatabaseSync` opened without `close()`
 *   and finalised under a forced GC, five times, crash none. The native finaliser is not it.
 *
 * At one in eighty-one, with no report and no isolated repro, **catching it in the act costs more
 * than waiting for it**. Reopen only with a mechanism in hand, never with more runs.
 *
 * Stated per project, and that is not redundancy: a project inherits nothing from the root `test`
 * block unless it says `extends`, and none here does. A review asked each project which side it
 * runs on: with the pool set at the root alone, all three answer `child_process`.
