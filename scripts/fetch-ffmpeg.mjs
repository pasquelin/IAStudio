/**
 * Fetches the ffmpeg and ffprobe the studio ships with, into `resources/ffmpeg/`.
 *
 * The studio carries its own encoder rather than asking for one: an import that needs a proxy
 * or a waveform is not the moment to teach someone what a codec is, and a Homebrew ffmpeg whose
 * library has moved looks installed while refusing to run.
 *
 * Run for the host platform by default, or for another one before packaging it:
 *
 *     node scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs                        # this machine
 *     node scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs --platform win32 --arch x64
 *
 * Extraction goes through `tar`, then `unzip` if that fails: bsdtar reads zip (macOS, and
 * Windows since 10/1803) while GNU tar, the default on Linux, reads tarballs only — and the
 * Windows and macOS targets are zips, which a Linux CI has every reason to fetch.
 *
 * Licences differ per target and that is deliberate: LGPL builds exist for Windows and Linux,
 * none does for macOS. Both are fine here because ffmpeg is spawned as a separate program, but
 * both also oblige us to offer FFmpeg's corresponding sources — hence the `sources` of each
 * target, pinned to the exact tarball or commit that build came from, written into the notice and
 * attached to the release by `--sources`.
 *
 * Every URL is pinned to a version and every extracted binary is checked against a recorded
 * digest: two builds of the same tag must ship the same encoder. Rotating a build means changing
 * the URL *and* the digest, which `--digests` prints:
 *
 *     node scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs --digests
 *
 * And the source archives the release must carry alongside the installers:
 *
 *     node scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs --sources dist
