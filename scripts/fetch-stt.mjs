/**
 * Fetches the voice activity detector dictation listens through, into `resources/stt/`.
 *
 * Only the detector, and deliberately so: it weighs 640 KB while the recognition model weighs
 * 640 MB. The small one ships, so the studio can open the microphone, draw a level and know
 * whether anyone is speaking without a download; the large one is fetched at runtime, once, by
 * `main/dictation/modelDownload.ts`.
 *
 *     node scripts/fetch-stt.mjs
 *     node scripts/fetch-stt.mjs --digests    # after rotating the URL
 *
 * Unlike ffmpeg there is nothing per-platform here: an ONNX file is the same bytes everywhere,
 * and it is read by the engine rather than executed. The rest is the same discipline — a pinned
 * URL, a recorded digest, and nothing unverified ever left at the path the engine loads from.
