/**
 * Collects the user manual into `src/shared/manual.json`, which the Help ▸ User manual window
 * reads. The markdown under `docs/{fr/manuel,en/manual}` stays the source and stays readable on
 * its own; this only carries it to a machine with no network.
 *
 * It REFUSES to write a manual whose links do not all resolve. That is the point of compiling
 * rather than reading the files at runtime: a chapter that lost its target fails the build here,
 * instead of offering a reader a link that does nothing.
 *
 * TypeScript rather than the `.mjs` its neighbours use — Node strips the types on the way in, and
 * `main/manual.test.ts` imports `buildManual` to recompute the whole file. One definition of what
 * a chapter is, or the guard drifts from what it guards.
