/**
 * The short loop: what `pnpm validate` asks, restricted to what the working tree touched.
 *
 * `validate` is the gate before a merge and stays that. It is not a loop to work in: it runs the
 * whole suite, and paid after every edit of a batch that is the hour a five-minute change turns
 * into.
 *
 * What this runs instead, for a touched component: the tests that transitively import it, the
 * guards no import graph reaches, and the three cached gates — 8,0 s wall clock on an idle
 * machine.
 *
 * The two suites run side by side rather than one after the other, and that was measured rather
 * than assumed: two alternating pairs on 2026-08-13 read 21,7 / 13,5 s sequential against
 * 12,0 / 7,6 s concurrent. A review reading the opposite had timed two lots of 29 files each —
 * the real split is lopsided, a handful of related tests beside the guards, so the small one
 * fills cores the big one leaves idle.
 *
 * It is NOT a replacement for `validate`, and one thing it cannot see says why: a test whose file
 * nothing under `src/` imports.
