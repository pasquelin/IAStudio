/**
 * Gives the development run the product's name and icon instead of Electron's.
 *
 * macOS reads the Dock label, the menu bar title and the icon from the running bundle, never
 * from `app.setName()` — the Electron docs are explicit that it "does not change the name
 * displayed by the operating system", and that the first application submenu "will always have
 * your application's name as its label". Unpackaged, that bundle is
 * `node_modules/.../Electron.app`, so the studio shows up as Electron with an atom beside it.
 *
 * A packaged build needs none of this: electron-builder writes a real bundle from
 * `productName` and `build/icon.png`. This only exists so development looks like the product.
 *
 * Runs on postinstall because pnpm re-extracts the bundle whenever Electron is reinstalled.
 * Takes an optional checkout root, so an existing worktree can be fixed without waiting for
 * its branch to carry this file: `node scripts/dev-app-identity.mjs .claude/worktrees/<name>`.
