/**
 * Fetches what the studio ships beside itself, right before electron-builder packs a target:
 * the ffmpeg of that target, the voice detector dictation listens through, and the interpreter
 * the local AI engine runs on.
 *
 * A single `pnpm dist` builds several targets — macOS ships arm64 and x64 from one run — while
 * `resources/ffmpeg/` holds one platform's binaries at a time. Left to a manual
 * `pnpm ffmpeg:fetch`, the second bundle would carry the first one's binary: signed, present,
 * and refusing to start on the machine it was built for. Worse, a clone that never ran the
 * fetch would produce a release with no encoder at all, silently.
 *
 * Hooked here rather than in `dist.sh` because this is the only place that knows which target
 * is being packed, and it runs once per target. Targets are packed one after another —
 * `concurrency.jobs: 1` is declared in `electron-builder.yml` for that reason — so they never
 * race over the folder.
