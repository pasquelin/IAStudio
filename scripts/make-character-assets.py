"""Builds the character resources the app ships with, from the sources they were authored in.

Run through Blender, which is the only reader here for FBX:

    /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background --factory-startup \
        --python scripts/make-character-assets.py -- <source folder> <resources folder>

The source folder holds `game/` — `character.glb` and Mixamo FBX clips — beside `optimization/`,
which holds the decimations of that same mesh. What
lands in `resources/` is glTF binary throughout: metadata is JSON there, so a clip's name, its
bone names and its copyright are all values rather than bytes at a fixed offset.

Bones are renamed to the studio's own humanoid roles — `shared/domain/humanoid.ts` — which is
what `character.glb` already spells. Two skeletons that agree on their names are what makes a
retarget a lookup rather than a guess.
